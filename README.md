This repo includes the quantum algorithm that I learned and coded before
Including starndard algorithm in the text book and some other published algorithm

I used shot-based and statevector simulation run the quantum algorithm mostly here

TODO list: 
VQE, KQD, SKQD, shor's algorithm, quantum amplification, parity measurement, purterbation, mid-circuit measurement, correlation funtion, OTOC,
