## Problem statement 

We are given a hidden boolean function $f$ in quantum computer (oracle). This function takes bitstring as input and output either 0 or 1 for each bit. 

$f({x_0, x_1, x_2,..., x_n}) \rightarrow 0 or 1 for each bit, where x_n is 0 or 1 

We hope that the function is either a constant function or a balanced.
